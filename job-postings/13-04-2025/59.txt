Genies Is An AI Avatar And Games Technology Company Powering The Next Generation Of Digital Experiences. Genies' Technology Stack Is Rooted In Empowering User Generated Content Through The Company's Two Main Mantras

“Anyone can create anything” & “Everything works with everything”

By combining these two guiding principles, individuals can craft limitless experiences while IP owners can build dynamic social gaming ecosystems powered by user-generated content (UGC) and AI Avatars—what Genies calls "Parties."

Genies' technology stack features a comprehensive suite of UGC tools that enable anyone to create AI avatars, complete with customizable fashion, props, behaviors, and personalities, as well as immersive AI avatar experiences. At its core is the Genies Avatar Framework, which leverages machine learning and computer graphics to ensure seamless interoperability across all user-generated AI avatars and experiences—unlocking boundless creative potential.

Early adopters of Genies’ first gen avatars include icons like Justin Bieber, Rihanna, J Balvin, Migos, and thousands more. With offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Genies has raised $200M from notable investors including Silver Lake, BOND, NEA, and Bob Iger.
