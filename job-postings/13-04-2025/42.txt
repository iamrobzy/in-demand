Oh, you want full startup-on-caffeine energy? Buckle up — here’s the maxed-out, no-experience, final-year/fresher-friendly ML Intern job post that’s funnier, bolder, and practically screaming “JOIN US, YOU LEGEND.”


WANTED : MACHINE LEARNING INTERN
JOB CODE: BLACK PANTHER

(a.k.a. The Chosen One Who Speaks Fluent Python and Slightly Regrets Installing TensorFlow)
Location: Chennai – IIT-MADRAS RESEARCH PARK
Duration: 6–12 months
Stipend: Yes. We don’t pay in pizza slices. (But we do give those too.)
Company: FinFresh – India’s Deeptech Fintech Circus (but smart)



THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

You’re a final-year student or a fresh grad. You’ve fought with models at 3am. You’ve lost to a missing comma.
Do you vibe with Pandas more than actual pandas?

You once trained a regression model and called it your child.

You’ve entered the ML arena — now it’s time to go pro.


WHO ARE WE?

We’re FinFresh — a startup building smart tech to fix the chaos that is personal finance in India.
Our tools are backed by ML, sprinkled with design, and powered by pure startup adrenaline.

There’s a super-secret, super-sexy product in the works.
We can’t tell you what it is yet…
But it might just change how India thinks about money (and make you a fintech superhero).



WHAT YOU’LL ACTUALLY DO (no fake intern work here):
• Build and train ML models that don’t live and die in a notebook
• Wrestle with real financial data (bring gloves, it’s messy)
• Work on real backend logic using Python / Go (don’t know it yet? No sweat. We’ll train you.)
• Collaborate with actual humans (founders, engineers, designers — not just ChatGPT)
• Take ownership, ship features, and feel like an absolute boss
• Learn, iterate, fail fast (sometimes), and ship fast (most times)



WHAT YOU DON’T NEED:
• Experience (LOL)
• A degree from Hogwarts
• A PhD in Rocket Finance



WHAT YOU DO NEED:
• Obsession with Python + curiosity for ML
• Some project, Kaggle, or code scrap that shows you’ve done something
• Eagerness to learn Go (and anything else we throw your way)
• A “let’s build this!” attitude
• The ability to laugh at your model before fixing it


WHAT YOU GET:
• 6–12 months of pure learning + chaos + ownership
• Actual stipend (because love doesn’t pay rent)
• Training by real ML Engineers who’ll mentor, guide, and occasionally roast you
• A shot at a full-time job — if you impress us (or at least don’t crash prod)
• The chance to say “See that feature? Yeah, I built that.”



TO APPLY:

Send your resume / GitHub / Colab / Kaggle / meme to [admin@finfresh.in]
Subject line: “ML Intern – BLACK PANTHER”


NO EXPERIENCE? NO PROBLEM. JUST SHOW UP WITH CURIOSITY, CODE, AND CONFIDENCE.
This isn’t just an internship.
It’s your launchpad.

Let’s make money smarter — and have some fun while we’re at it.
