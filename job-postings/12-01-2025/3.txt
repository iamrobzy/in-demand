How you will lead

Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models.
Build "machine learning ready" feature pipelines.
Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms.
Run regular A/B tests, gather data, and draw conclusions on the impact of your models.
Monitor and maintain production models.
Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders.
Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver.
