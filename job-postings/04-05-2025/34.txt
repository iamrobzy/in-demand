Manage job queues, webhooks, rate limits, and data ingestion pipelines
Process and analyze large datasets from public social APIs
Collaborate with product to translate scoring ideas into measurable systems

Requirements:
3+ years experience in backend engineering (Node.js, Python, or Go)
Experience with machine learning fundamentals and model deployment
Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and systems architecture
Familiarity with real-time processing and caching solutions (e.g., Redis, Kafka)
Comfortable working with APIs (especially social data APIs like Twitter)

Nice to Have:
