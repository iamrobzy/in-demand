üöÄ Join Us as a Founding Member of Technical Staff (ML Engineering & Research)

We‚Äôre an open-source platform shaping the future of large language models (LLMs) by transforming production data into smarter, faster, and more cost-efficient solutions. Our platform creates a continuous feedback loop that optimizes LLM applications through smarter inference, real-time observability, and seamless experimentation.

You‚Äôll contribute to an open-source project tackling exciting challenges like advanced inference techniques and cutting-edge optimization methods, including reinforcement learning. Your work will span across the stack, providing opportunities to blend ML research with systems engineering.

Who We‚Äôre Looking For
We don‚Äôt separate ‚Äúengineers‚Äù from ‚Äúresearchers.‚Äù Instead, we focus on building a team that thrives on cross-functional collaboration and impactful contributions. If you‚Äôre passionate about solving complex technical problems and pushing boundaries, this is the role for you.

Key Qualifications:
Strong technical expertise: You‚Äôve led large-scale projects from ideation to deployment, solving challenging problems along the way.
Experience with LLMs or RL: You bring technical depth and leadership, ideally having worked at the forefront of these fields.
Growth-oriented mindset: You‚Äôre excited to work in a fast-paced enviro

‚ú® If you‚Äôre passionate about the intersection of open source, machine learning, and impactful innovation, this is your opportunity to make a difference.
