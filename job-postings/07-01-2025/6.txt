Job Description

Arm's Machine Learning Group is seeking highly motivated and creative Software Engineers to join the Cambridge-based ML Content, Algorithms and Tools team!

This Machine Learning Engineer role focuses on advancing the field of AI by optimizing and deploying pioneering models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI algorithms. This involves deep analysis of neural networks, optimizing software and hardware, developing innovative solutions, and collaborating with teams to build high-performance AI systems.

Responsibilities

Your responsibilities involve working with major ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) to port and develop ML networks, optimize and quantize models for efficient execution on Arm platforms, and help ensure multiple Arm products are designed to perform effectively for machine learning. As an in-depth technical responsibility, you will need to deeply understand the complex applications you analyze and communicate them in their simplest form to contribute to product designs, allowing you to influence both IP and system architecture.

Required Skills And Experience

A background in computer science, software engineering or other comparable skills
Experience training and debugging neural networks with TensorFlow and PyTorch using Python
Understanding, deploying, and optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI algorithms.
Experience using software development platforms and continuous integration systems
Familiarity with Linux and cloud services
Have a strong attention to detail to ensure use cases you investigate are well understood and the critical areas needing improvement are understood 

Nice To Have Skills And Experience

Experience of the inner workings of Pytorch, Tensorflow, Executorch and Tensorflow Lite
Experience of developing and maintaining CI/testing components to improve automation of model analysis
Good knowledge of Python for working with ML frameworks
Good knowledge of C++ for working with optimised ML libraries
Previous experience of machine learning projects
Experience with deployment optimizations on machine learning models 

In Return 

From research to proof-of-concept development, to deployment on ARM IPs, joining this team would be a phenomenal opportunity to contribute to the full life cycle of machine learning projects and understand how innovative machine learning is used to solve real word problems.

Working closely with experts in ML and software and hardware optimisation - a truly multi-discipline environment - you will have the chance to explore existing or build new machine learning techniques, while helping unpick the complex world of use-cases spanning mobile phones, servers, autonomous driving vehicles, and low-power embedded devices
