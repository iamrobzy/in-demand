EvenUp is one of the fastest-growing generative AI startups in history, on a mission to level the playing field for personal injury victims, which range from motor vehicle accidents to child abuse cases. Our products empower law firms to secure faster settlements, higher payouts, and better outcomes for those who need it most.

At EvenUp, we leverage the power of technology to bring fairness and accessibility to the legal system. Large language models (LLMs) are a new type of intelligence and represent an important part of our technology strategy. To fully realize the potential of this technology, we recognize the need for a systematic, creative, and rigorous approach to instructing LLMs and evaluating their output.

With the field of prompt engineering still evolving, finding the right expertise can be a challenge. That's why we're seeking a Staff Machine Learning Engineer eager to join EvenUp's mission. Our interdisciplinary team - with backgrounds in industry as well as academic research in physics, ML, neuroscience, and more - hopes to foster an environment where we can systematically discover state of the art techniques and be the best in the world at applying them to the challenging problems we encounter in the legal domain. In fact, we already have a number of areas where we exceed the publicly known SOTA and this person will help us expand beyond.
