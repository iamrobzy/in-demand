Job Description

PostgresML is a PostgreSQL extension, which inverts the current paradigm of continuously moving the data to the Large Language Models (LLM). Instead, it moves the models to the (local) database. PostgresML allows to take advantage of the fundamental relationship between data and models and thus allows for local access to the latest open-source ML & AI algorithms, eg from Huggingface inside the database with a SQL API. It also provides native language SDKs to access the models as well as support for GPU acceleration.

Your Tasks

ELCA Has Gained Previous Experience With PostgresML And Based On The Resulting Proof Of Concept (PoC) Aims To Revisit The Key Topics In a Follow-up Project

Integrated Learning: Embeds machine learning directly within the PostgreSQL database, reducing latency, improving data processing efficiency, and ensuring a secure data flow
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework: Combines generative AI with retrieval systems (vector search) for precise and contextually relevant responses

Design part (UI): Interactive user interface, with planned enhancements for usability
Get familiar with the features of PostgresML and gain experience with running it on a local machine as well as on AWS (or OKD)
Document the trade-offs between the quality attributes of the LLMs vs the needed resources to run the LLMs, eg quantization, fine tuning small LLMs
Rewrite the current PoC to handle more traffic and to become more stable and resilient, eg large context windows
Extend the current PoC with additional enhancements, eg Agents
Present the results in an ELCA Brownbag session
