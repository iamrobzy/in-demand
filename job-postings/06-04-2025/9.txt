The E-Commerce Risk Control (ECRC) team is missioned: 
- To protect Tiktok E-Commerce users, including and beyond buyer, seller, creator;
- By securing the integrity of our ecommerce ecosystem and providing a safe shopping experience on the platform;
- Through building infrastructures, platforms and technologies, as well as collaborating with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

The ECRC team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on Tiktok E-Commerce platforms (e.g. TikTok Shop, Jumanji, Fanno), covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, incentive abuse, malicious activities, brushing, click-farm, information leakage etc.

In this team you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure and product-friendly systems and solutions.

The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to making quick and solid differences.
