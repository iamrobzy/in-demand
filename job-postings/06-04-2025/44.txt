Principal Machine Learning Engineer, ADMET | Pharma/BioTech expertise | Series A - Drug discovery B2B Platform | Fully Remote, EU || Fully Remote, EU | Base Salary Up to £160,000K, plus early equity+benefits 

The Client:
A mission-driven technology company operating in the life sciences domain is seeking a Principal Machine Learning Engineer to lead the technical direction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) modeling efforts within its drug discovery platform. The organisation enables collaborative model development across partner organisations while maintaining strict data privacy and ownership, using a federated data infrastructure.

In this hands-on, high-impact role, you’ll work at the intersection of machine learning, computational chemistry, and applied research to advance foundational model applications in drug discovery. You'll be the technical authority on ML architecture, experimentation, and strategy, collaborating closely with leadership and mentoring other engineers and researchers. While this is not a people management position, it offers significant influence over technical direction.

Responsibilities for the Principal Machine Learning Engineer, ADMET | Pharma/BioTech expertise | Series A - Drug discovery B2B Platform | Fully Remote, EU || Fully Remote, EU | Base Salary Up to £160,000K, plus early equity+benefits 

Lead the design and implementation of ML solutions for ADMET using cutting-edge techniques such as graph neural networks and transformers.
Develop and extend models for specific applications, including data distillation, benchmarking, and evaluation.
Define preprocessing and harmonization strategies for diverse assay datasets used in ADMET modeling.
Build and maintain scalable, production-grade ML pipelines for training, inference, and deployment.
Collaborate cross-functionally to ensure ML efforts are aligned with real-world drug discovery needs.
Mentor team members in designing and executing complex modeling projects in structural biology.
Contribute to strategic decisions regarding ML infrastructure, model architecture, and deployment processes.
Author or contribute to scientific publications or open-source software where appropriate.

Expected Milestones
By Month 3: Own an ADMET modeling stream and deliver a roadmap with a structured experimentation plan tailored to a key use case.
By Month 12: Lead multiple ADMET ML initiatives, showing measurable performance improvements and tangible real-world outcomes. Serve as a strategic technical voice within the team.
