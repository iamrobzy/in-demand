About Lightfield

Lightfield is a new kind of CRM.

It's a collaborative system for founders to find, understand, and serve customers faster than anything before it.

It captures every customer interaction, generates and performs followup actions, and answers questions about your go-to-market using knowledge obtained in real time.

Our system is tuned and customized by a team of experienced sellers, engineers, and researchers. Many of us worked on large-scale products including Llama, Messenger, Instagram, Pinterest, and Linkedin before this.
