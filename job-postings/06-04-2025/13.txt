üëã ABOUT CURVECATCH
CurveCatch is a Belgian venture-backed startup revolutionising the way people shop for intimate apparel. We‚Äôre a bra shopping companion that plugs into any intimate apparel webshop and uses AI to help shoppers find the perfect bra. We help shoppers with style, shape and size and reduce the number of decisions and clicks they have to make. This way we fast-track them to conversion to grow webshop revenue and shopper delight. We operate on a SaaS business model.
Before launching as a SaaS, we were our own first customer with our home-try-on e-commerce service. It‚Äôs a 7-figure profitable business that allows us to be very close to end-users.
We started from the local specialty shops of founder Kimia‚Äôs parents during Covid-19. Since then, we‚Äôre a team of 5 and have raised just under ‚Ç¨1 million in pre-seed funding from strategic angels, accelerator XX in San Francisco, an innovation grant, and a grant from Y Combinator.
Never thought your next adventure would be in the lingerie sector? Stick around and find out!

üöÄ WHAT WILL YOU DO?
As our Machine Learning Engineer, you'll be pivotal in developing and deploying the AI that powers CurveCatch's personalization magic. You'll work across the ML lifecycle to deliver impactful models and shape our AI strategy. Your responsibilities will likely include:
Designing, developing, training, and deploying machine learning models to enhance product personalization (style, shape, size) and recommendation systems.
Researching and implementing novel ML techniques and algorithms suitable for our unique lingerie domain datasets.
Managing and improving the end-to-end ML workflow, including data preparation, feature engineering, model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring in production.
Optimizing ML models and infrastructure for performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness (leveraging tools like AWS Sagemaker, Metaflow, W&B and making smart use of cloud credits).
Collaborating closely with the CTO (Nils) on the AI/R&D roadmap, data strategy, and continuous improvement of our MLOps processes and lean toolstack (Postgres, DBT, Snowflake, PyTorch etc.).
Working with our Engineer (Denis) on infrastructure decisions impacting data and AI systems.
Providing input on product features related to ML models and data collection, championing data quality ("garbage in, garbage out").
Actively seeking and implementing ways to automate and streamline ML processes to maximize time spent on modelling and impact.

üëä WHY IS YOUR ROLE CRUCIAL FOR US?
Your work is core to our product's unique value. You will directly accelerate the development and release of foundational AI models, making our service significantly more compelling through deeper personalization and accuracy. Without you, our AI development would be slower, limiting the features and value we can offer customers. Your contributions will directly impact business outcomes by optimizing revenue through better recommendations or reducing costs through automation, ensuring CurveCatch stays at the forefront of AI in this domain.

üèÜ ABOUT THE TEAM
Kimia (CEO): Our growth & finance lead, the push-up bra of the team ‚Äì an eternal dreamer and optimist driving us forward.
Nils (CTO): Our software & recommender systems guru, the spacer bra ‚Äì the experimenter and brain behind our innovations. (You'll work very closely with Nils, defining the roadmap and improving our ML stack).
Lore (Operations Manager): Our process & onboarding expert, the balcony bra ‚Äì keeping us all tightly together.
Denis (Engineering): Our seamless bra, making complex engineering look simple. (You'll collaborate with Denis on engineering/data intersections).
Veerle, Sanne, Marjolein and Eden (Lingerie Guides): Our frontline experts providing incredible support.
Machine Learning Engineer (You!): You'll be the driving force behind our production ML models and AI capabilities. You'll have significant autonomy and impact, with the willingness to potentially coach a junior/intern down the line as the team grows.

üí™üí™üí™ MUST-HAVE QUALIFICATIONS
Proven experience designing, building, training, and deploying machine learning models in a production environment.
Strong theoretical understanding and practical application of ML fundamentals (algorithms, evaluation, feature engineering).
Proficiency in Python and common ML libraries/frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas).
Strong SQL skills and experience with data processing and warehousing concepts (experience with tools like DBT, Snowflake is a plus).
Hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS preferred, GCP useful) and familiarity with MLOps principles and tools (e.g., Metaflow, W&B, Sagemaker, or similar).
A pragmatic approach focused on delivering impactful ML solutions efficiently in a small team ("garbage in, garbage out" mindset, passion for automation).
Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to independently drive research and development projects.
Strong communication skills in English.

üí™ NICE-TO-HAVE QUALIFICATIONS
Experience specifically with personalization or recommendation systems.
Experience working in an e-commerce environment.
Experience working in a start-up environment.
Experience with any of our specific stack tools (DBT, Snowflake, Metaflow, W&B, Sagemaker, Hex, Metabase).
Experience mentoring junior data professionals or interns.

üíî WHY WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THIS ROLE?
You prefer highly specialized roles (e.g., only research, only ops) rather than working across the full ML lifecycle.
You thrive in large, established teams with extensive existing infrastructure and tooling support. (We value a lean setup).
You dislike ambiguity and prefer very clearly defined tasks over exploring datasets and proposing solutions.
You aren't passionate about maintaining high data quality as a foundation for good models.
Honestly ‚Ä¶ we can't think of anything else. This is an out-of-this-world opportunity üöÄ!

üíú OUR VALUES
