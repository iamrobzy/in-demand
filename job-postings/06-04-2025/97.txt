Join our team of machine learning experts to develop and implement cutting-edge models specifically tailored for price optimization. You will work closely with data scientists to deploy low latency services in production with the objective to infer customer willingness to pay and optimize bid pricing, leveraging theories of opportunity cost. Your work will directly influence pricing strategies for millions of customers.



YOUR ROLE AT SIXT

Model Deployment and Optimization: You will collaborate with data scientists to deploy and optimize machine learning models focused on price optimization ranging from an array of techniques, including and not limited to Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting methods, Genetic Algorithms, Linear Programming, and Time Series Forecasting.
Build and Maintain ML Pipelines: You will design, develop, and maintain robust pipelines specifically for deploying and scaling machine learning models that drive dynamic pricing strategies. Ensure these pipelines are scalable, reliable, and seamlessly integrated with the company's existing systems.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: You will work closely with data scientists, product managers, and software engineers to transform experimental models into operational systems that effectively drive pricing optimization and enhance business outcomes.
Monitoring and Performance Tuning: You will continuously monitor deployed models for performance and accuracy. Implement feedback loops and conduct regular updates to refine models in response to market changes and business needs.
Scalability and Automation: You will automate tasks and build infrastructure capable of handling large-scale data processing and complex model serving, ensuring systems are scalable and capable of executing real-time pricing adjustments.
Knowledge Sharing: You will document best practices and deployment workflows related to price optimization. Share technical insights and model impacts with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to foster understanding and drive strategic decisions.




YOUR SKILLS MATTER

Strong Foundations in Machine Learning Engineering: Experience in building, deploying, and maintaining ML models in production environments.
Proficiency in Python and ML Frameworks: Skilled in production-oriented machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
Experience with ML Pipeline Tools: Familiarity with tools like MLflow and Airflow for managing machine learning workflows.
Understanding of Causal Inference Models: Knowledge of A/B testing, difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and double machine learning, as they relate to pricing.
Cloud and Big Data Experience: Hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS) and big data technologies like Spark, Dask, or Polars.
Collaboration and Communication Skills: Ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams, understanding modeling requirements, and translating them into scalable engineering solutions.
Problem-Solving Mindset: Proactive approach and a passion for solving complex pricing challenges through advanced engineering solutions.
