Your Job

The growing demand for energy transformation to counter the effects of climate change and reduce dependence on imported energy sources and raw materials is driving the European energy system towards a dynamic, supply- and demand-driven approach, often organized in local energy communities with a high penetration of renewable resources.

Power grids are critical infrastructure requiring ultra-reliable state estimation and control. With rising renewable energy integration, operators need certifiable performance guarantees to prevent blackouts while optimizing grid efficiency. Current models struggle to quantify uncertainty, risking overconfidence in volatile scenarios.

The goal is to enhance grid stability predictions by integrating probabilistic models with dynamic decision-making strategies.

Your Tasks In Detail

Enhance existing Bayesian state estimation with reliability margins using both simulated and, if necessary, real-world grid data.
Develop Use-Case-Specific Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Grid Optimization linked to Bayesian uncertainty outputs
Test bidirectional interaction: Bayesian updates → Reinforcement Learning policy adaptation → grid performance feedback.
Validate on Critical Infrastructure Scenarios
Formalize Performance Guarantees for Deployment 

Your Profile:

Excellent university degree (Bachelor) in field of Data Science or a comparable field i.e. Electrical Engineering, Computer Science/ Engineering or Physics
Strong mathematical background
Interest in energy systems, power grids and communication infrastructures
Excellent knowledge and experience in programming Python
Excellent knowledge and experience in machine learning
Experience with git is welcome
Excellent ability for cooperative collaboration
Very good communication skills in English
Prior German knowledge is not strictly required
