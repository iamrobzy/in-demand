Position: Machine Learning Engineer (Entry-Level, LLM Focus)
Location: Fully Remote (India-Based)
Start Date: Immediate
Format: Full time 

Compensation: Competitive Salary + Strong Equity Offering + Benefits

Who We Are
Gabeo.ai is a cutting-edge health tech startup based in the Bay Area (USA), collaborating with industry leaders like Astrana Health, Athena Health and Rebound Orthopedics. Our goal? Transform the healthcare revenue cycle by using advanced AI to tackle denied medical claimsâ€”one of the sectorâ€™s biggest financial headaches.

At Gabeo.ai, we pride ourselves on:

Innovation: We push boundaries and welcome out-of-the-box thinking.
Collaboration: Weâ€™re a tight-knit team that values open communication.
Impact: Your work will directly influence our AI-driven products and customer outcomes.

Role Overview

At Gabeo.ai, we are pioneering AI Agent Frameworks designed to automate and optimize complex tasks within healthcare revenue cycle management. These intelligent agents leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized domain knowledge to autonomously analyze claim data, predict denials, and execute strategic interventions. By continuously learning from real-world feedback and historical patterns, our agent-based systems evolve over time, adapting to new payer policies and medical coding updates. The result is a robust, scalable framework that reduces manual workload, accelerates claim resolution, and drives financial efficiency for healthcare providers. Weâ€™re seeking an entry-level Machine Learning Engineer with a keen interest in Large Language Models (LLMs)and NLP. Youâ€™ll join our global team to develop and refine AI models for U.S. healthcare revenue cycle management. This position offers real-world exposure to cutting-edge AI in a domain that truly needs innovation.

Note: While we encourage applications from candidates who have graduated from top-tier Indian institutes (e.g., IIT, NIT, IIIT, BITS, etc.), we welcome all qualified applicants who demonstrate strong fundamentals and a passion for AI.

Key Responsibilities

Model Development: Collaborate on designing, developing, and optimizing ML modelsâ€”particularly LLMsâ€”for tasks like claim denial analysis and predictive analytics.
Data Handling: Assist in data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering specific to healthcare RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) problems.
Research & Experimentation: Stay updated with the latest AI/ML trends and apply new techniques to improve model performance.
Integration & Deployment: Work closely with senior engineers to integrate models into production environments, ensuring scalability and reliability.
Performance Monitoring: Help monitor model accuracy and efficiency, proposing iterative improvements based on feedback and metrics.

Qualifications

Education: Bachelorâ€™s or Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or related fields.
Graduates from IIT, NIT, IIIT, BITS, or equivalent institutions are strongly encouraged to apply.
Technical Skills:
Proficiency in Python and popular ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Familiarity with NLP techniques, LLMs, and transformer-based architectures.
Problem-Solving: Eagerness to tackle complex datasets and real-world issues in the U.S. healthcare domain.
Team Player: Ability to communicate effectively with a distributed team, including data scientists, product managers, and domain experts.

What We Offer

Real-World Impact: Contribute to AI solutions that directly benefit healthcare providers and patients.
Mentorship & Growth: Learn from experienced data scientists and healthcare tech specialists.
Competitive Package: Enjoy a market-aligned salary plus strong equity for an ownership stake in Gabeo.aiâ€™s success.
Remote Flexibility: Work from anywhere in India, collaborating with a global, diverse team.

Why Join Gabeo.ai?

High-Growth Environment: Weâ€™re rapidly expanding, offering plenty of opportunities for leadership and skill development.
Cutting-Edge AI: Work on advanced ML/AI projects that push the boundaries of LLM applications in healthcare.
Startup Culture: Enjoy a fast-paced setting where your ideas can quickly translate to tangible impact.
