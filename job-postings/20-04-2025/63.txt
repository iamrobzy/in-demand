You will design machine learning systems that not only process and analyze data but also bring critical insights to the surface in a way that empowers decision-making. What You’ll Do

Deploy and maintain containerized workloads to support machine learning development, deployment, and post-deployment monitoring. Utilize tools like Helm and Kustomize to accelerate the deployment of machine learning models and data pipelines. Apply various optimization techniques such as compilation, quantization-aware training (QAT), and pruning to improve the latency and throughput of models. Utilize open-source software like Metaflow, Prefect, Temporal, and Argo Workflows to facilitate data science development. Build and optimize machine learning models to analyze security data, extract actionable insights, and identify trends, anomalies, and other relevant security signals. Develop and maintain systems for drift detection and model monitoring to ensure continuous improvement and accuracy of insights. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design data pipelines that can efficiently process petabytes of raw internet security data. Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or other technical discipline (or equivalent professional experience). 5+ years of experience in docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. Strong proficiency in Python and machine learning libraries like PyTorch, Transformers, and Timm. Strong proficiency in MLOps tooling like Metaflow, MLflow, Argo Workflows, Torchrun, and Ray. Experience with streaming data processing frameworks like Kafka and Spark. Experience with applying model optimization techniques such as quantization, pruning, and distillation to improve performance. Experience working with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Preferred Qualifications

Experience working in the cyber security domain. Strong communication skills, including the ability to collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Experience with DevOps tooling like Grafana and Prometheus. Proficiency in GoLang and Protocol Buffers. Our target salary range for this role is between $190,000 USD and $250,000 USD + bonus eligibility and equity. In addition to our great compensation package, our benefits are effective on day one and include but are not limited to: 401k match, health, vision, dental, and more! Please see our careers page for more details. Our roots are in Ann Arbor, Michigan with location hubs in Seattle, the Bay Area, and Washington D.C. Our innovation is fueled by the team’s global perspectives.

For this role, we are looking for candidates based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Tysons Corner, VA, Kirkland, WA, OR Los Altos, CA.
