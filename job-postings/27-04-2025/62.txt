Role Overview
As a Junior Machine Learning Engineer, you will:
Apply your strong foundation in machine learning and Python to develop end-to-end AI solutions.
Leverage generative AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to accelerate prototyping, data exploration, and code generation.
Design, implement, and train models from scratch using frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Collaborate with senior engineers and data scientists to integrate models into production systems.
Continuously learn and experiment with emerging AI/ML tools, techniques, and best practices.
Key Responsibilities
Model Development:
Build and train supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models from the ground up.
Implement data preprocessing, feature engineering, and augmentation pipelines in Python.
AI Tooling & Automation:
Utilize ChatGPT, Gemini, and similar large-language-model tools to streamline coding tasks, generate documentation, and explore novel solution approaches.
Automate routine workflows (data cleaning, model evaluation) to improve team productivity.
Collaboration & Integration:
Work closely with cross-functional teams (data engineering, product, DevOps) to understand requirements and deploy ML solutions.
Write clean, maintainable code and contribute to version-controlled repositories.
Evaluation & Optimization:
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics; identify areas for improvement.
Optimize model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures for efficiency and accuracy.
Continuous Learning:
Stay current with the latest research in machine learning, deep learning, and AI tooling.
Share learnings and best practices through knowledge-sharing sessions and documentation.
