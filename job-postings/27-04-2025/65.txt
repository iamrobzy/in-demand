🧠 About Darwix AI
Darwix AI is one of India’s fastest-growing AI-first startups, transforming how enterprise sales teams across India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia drive conversations and close deals. Our GenAI-powered Conversational Intelligence and Real-Time Agent Assist products analyze millions of sales conversations in real-time, generating hyper-personalized nudges, insights, and decision support for revenue teams.
Our clients span multiple geographies and industries, and our systems work across voice, chat, CRM, and telephony—in multiple languages and enterprise environments.
We are backed by top-tier venture funds and a world-class team of AI scientists, product leaders, and go-to-market specialists from IITs, IIMs, BITS Pilani, Meta, and Salesforce.

🎯 Role Overview
As a Machine Learning Engineer at Darwix AI, you will own and implement ML models that form the backbone of our real-time AI systems. You will work on language modeling, speech-to-text pipelines, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, and real-time inferencing architectures that run across 20+ enterprise clients and tens of thousands of end users.
This is not a research-only role—we’re looking for applied ML experts who can build production-grade systems at scale and collaborate closely with product and engineering teams to push GenAI beyond the buzzwords.

🛠️ Key Responsibilities🔍 Model Development
Build, fine-tune, and deploy models across:
ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for multi-lingual transcripts (Whisper, Deepgram, custom wav2vec2 models).
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for extracting speaker intent, sentiment, action items, and more.
Language Models (LLMs) and RAG systems for contextual query resolution, summarization, and suggestions.
Evaluate model architectures using precision, recall, latency, throughput, and cost per inference.
Maintain and experiment with SLMs (Small Language Models) for high-speed use cases.

📦 Data Pipeline Engineering
Collaborate with backend engineers to build end-to-end training pipelines using FastAPI, Python, Airflow, and Redis.
Build scalable ingestion and transformation pipelines for text, audio, CRM metadata, and user annotations.
Structure, preprocess, clean, and annotate large-scale datasets for training and evaluation.

🧪 Model Evaluation & Monitoring
Design custom evaluation metrics and benchmarking pipelines (e.g., WER, ROUGE, BLEU, Latency vs. Quality).
Deploy ML models into real-time agent assist systems with high uptime and observability.
Set up monitoring and alerting to ensure model degradation is caught and addressed early.

🔄 Deployment & DevOps
Containerize models using Docker, deploy them via Kubernetes or CI/CD pipelines.
Optimize inference using tools like ONNX, TorchScript, TensorRT, vLLM, or LoRA.
Handle model versioning and release management in production-grade environments.

📈 Product & Cross-Team Collaboration
Translate business and product problems into ML problems, prototype solutions, and align on priorities.
Work with product managers and clients to gather feedback, validate ML outputs, and iterate fast.
Collaborate with UI/UX and full-stack teams to ensure AI insights are delivered intuitively and with context.

✅ Required Qualifications🔍 Technical Expertise
2–5 years of experience in machine learning, preferably in applied AI or NLP-heavy environments.
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience in ML libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, or transformers.
Experience with real-time ML or streaming inferencing systems.
Familiarity with speech models (Whisper, DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec2) and LLMs (OpenAI, LLaMA, GPT-Neo, Falcon, Mistral).
📊 Data Engineering & Deployment
Strong understanding of end-to-end ML lifecycles—data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Experience with cloud environments (AWS/GCP) and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).
Experience integrating vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate, LlamaIndex) into ML pipelines.
🧠 Core Skills
Experience working with multi-lingual data, speech data, or noisy enterprise datasets is a big plus.
Excellent problem-solving skills and a product mindset.
Demonstrated ability to thrive in ambiguity and move fast in early-stage product teams.
💡 Bonus Points
Experience building or fine-tuning RAG pipelines using LangChain, LLMChain, or similar.
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and low-latency inference strategies.
Background in Information Retrieval, Dialogue Systems, or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Exposure to annotation tools (e.g., Prodigy, Label Studio) and ML observability platforms.
🧬 What You'll Work With
Languages & Frameworks: Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, TensorFlow, ONNX
Data Infra: Redis, Kafka, Postgres, MongoDB
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, MLflow, DVC
Cloud Platforms: AWS, GCP (optional)
ML APIs: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Cohere, AssemblyAI
