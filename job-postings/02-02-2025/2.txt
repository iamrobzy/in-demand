Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the mission to be the most trusted driver. Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.

The Simulator team builds state-of-the-art simulations of realistic environments for the testing and training of the Waymo driver. We use machine learning to model the real world, including realistic agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists etc.), roads, traffic control systems, and weather. To increase the fidelity and steerability of the simulations, we employ large foundation models, trained on our massive datasets that allow us to quickly setup and rollout multiple scenarios to subject our driver to.

We have set up a team in London UK to work with the teams in MTV and Oxford to build these foundation models out and to integrate them into several evaluation and training products. We are looking for research engineers to work on these exciting problems.

In this hybrid role, you will report to an Engineering Manager.
