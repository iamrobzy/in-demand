About Influur

Influur is the first startup that works as an app-based marketplace by directly creating jobs for Influencers, Creators, and Brands around the world. The company was born from the communication struggles between influencers and brands, an experience that like many others, our founding team had at some point in their careers. We have created a streamlined solution built from the influencer perspective, making Influur the first platform where influencers feel they belong in a professional space.

At Influur, our leadership team loves working side by side with our team, providing unique opportunities to grow and develop, professionally and personally.
